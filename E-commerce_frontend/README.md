# Kamagere Mart — Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

This is a complete frontend starter for a grocery/e-commerce workflow inspired by the currently visible Kamagere Mart site.

The current public site exposes these customer flows: delivery address, search, profile/login/register, cart, checkout, COD/UPI selection, orders and password/account flows. The project below turns those flows into separate VS Code pages with responsive navigation and localStorage-based frontend state.

## Tech
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- localStorage for frontend demo state
- Optional Google Apps Script adapter
- Optional GCP architecture notes

## Run in VS Code

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the "Live Server" extension.
3. Right-click `index.html` -> "Open with Live Server".
4. Test:
   - Home/search/category
   - Add to cart
   - Cart quantity changes
   - Checkout
   - Address
   - COD/UPI selection
   - Place order
   - Orders
   - Login/register
   - Profile/logout
   - Mobile bottom navigation

## Important frontend limitation

This is frontend-only. Authentication, email OTP, real inventory, order persistence, UPI payment verification, admin operations and secure customer data require a backend.

For a real deployment, connect `apps-script/Code.gs` or a GCP API and replace localStorage calls with fetch() calls.

## Suggested production workflow

Customer
  -> Home
  -> Search/category
  -> Product
  -> Add to cart
  -> Cart
  -> Login/register
  -> Delivery address
  -> Payment selection
  -> Payment/UPI handoff
  -> Order confirmation
  -> Orders/tracking

Admin/backend
  -> Products
  -> Inventory
  -> Orders
  -> Customers
  -> Delivery status
  -> Payment reconciliation

## UI/UX requirements covered

- Responsive desktop/tablet/mobile layouts
- Sticky desktop header
- Mobile bottom navigation
- Clear CTA buttons
- Large touch targets
- Cart badge
- Empty states
- Checkout summary
- Address capture
- Search and category filters
- Accessible form labels
- Minimal dependency footprint

## Production security

Do not implement password verification, OTP verification, UPI signature validation or payment confirmation only in browser JavaScript. Those must be handled server-side.


## Cart vs Buy Now workflow

The frontend now uses two separate localStorage concepts:

- `km_cart` — persistent shopping cart. Products added with **Add to Cart** live here.
- `km_buy_now` — temporary Buy Now checkout session. It contains only the selected product and quantity and is never added to `km_cart`.

### Expected behavior

1. Add Product A and Product B to Cart.
2. Open Product C and click **Buy Now**.
3. Checkout shows **Product C only**.
4. Place the Buy Now order.
5. Products A and B remain in the cart.
6. Open Cart and click **Proceed to Checkout** to buy A and B later.

Delivery:
- subtotal above ₹99 → FREE
- subtotal of ₹99 or less → ₹25

The same delivery rule is used for Cart checkout and Buy Now checkout. The API
recalculates the item prices and delivery charge from the database.

At checkout, **Use my current location** asks for browser location permission,
shows the selected point on Google Maps, and adds a Google Maps link to the
delivery address. Browser geolocation requires HTTPS or localhost; customers
can always enter their address manually.


## Authentication validation

Customer Login, Customer Registration, and Admin Login validate email addresses on the client and server.

Password policy:
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special symbol

Admin login requires backend environment variables. Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and set your real credentials. Never commit `.env`.

The frontend customer login now uses email + password. Customer registration still collects a phone number and validates it as a 10-digit Indian mobile number.

Admin authentication is intentionally handled by the backend rather than hard-coded in frontend JavaScript.

In the Admin dashboard, select a product's **Edit** button to update its
details. The product photo input opens the rear camera on supported phones or
lets you choose an image; the browser resizes photos before saving.
